The purpose of this project was to learn about embedding languages.
I had already started making color conversion functions in python to make
my homework easier and I wanted some experience with writing a bindings
library and embedded languages so I chose to expand on that. Speed was not
a goal of this learning exercise; if it was, I wouldn't be embedding python
and probably use the OpenGL Mathematics Library instead.
